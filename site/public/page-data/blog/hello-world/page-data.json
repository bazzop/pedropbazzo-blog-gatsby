Next.js is an open source framework under the MIT license and is being used by several companies with good growth in the market.</p>\n<p>With all these pre-configured facilities it is assimilated to a create react app where you start the project very fast and without worrying about webpack settings, folder structures, route configuration and so on.</p>\n<p>About Next.js:</p>\n<p>Main features of Next.js\nNext.js and Server Side Rendering\nMini introductory class on Next.js\nHow to start a project with Next.js\nIndication of plugins and packages\nMain features of Next.js\nHybrid SSG and SSR: Render the pages during the build (Static Site Generation) or on each request (Server-side Rendering) in the same project.\nHot Code Reloading: Any changes made to your code during development will be reflected in the local application in real time, updating automatically.\nAutomatic Routing: The URLs in Next js are mapped based on the <code>pages</code> folder, so any file in this folder becomes a page, without the need for extra configuration. (you can customize this if you need to)\nAutomatic Code Splitting: This functionality allows pages to be rendered only with the packages they need. Let's say that only one page of your website uses Ant Design, this package will only be linked to this page. This ensures that each page has only the code necessary for its rendering, decreasing the size (kB) of each page and improving the rendering speed. There was a contribution from the Google team to improve this functionality recently.\nTypeScript support: Integrated automatic configuration and compilation similar to an IDE.\nInternationalization: As a standard, Next.js already has a structure for identifying different languages, working with exclusive routes and translations via locale.\nImage Optimization: Next's native component for optimizing your images with resizing, lazyload, images in a modern format and easy to implement.\nNext.js and Server Side Rendering\nThe big difference at the beginning of Next was the possibility of using rendering on the server side (SSR) this solves a problem in applications and websites built with React that mainly need SEO. In some React applications you will find that it is not always efficient to load all content on the client side (client-side) which is the React standard. Currently Next js is able to work in a hybrid way with SSG and SSR.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0o844t6O--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/odkb0v27gaimxvuh5qaz.png\"></p>\n<p>16 February 2021 | 5 min read</p>\n<h2>[EN-US] Angular</h2>\n<p>Angular is a JavaScript (Typescript) based framework developed by Google for building web applications. Angular was established in 2009 as AngularJS, which used JavaScript as it’s a programming language, but in 2016, Google completely rewrites Angular. Since then, Angular Use Typescript as its language, typescript, is similar to JavaScript, and it is also considered as the superset of JavaScript.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> is a front-end Web Framework so we can only make client-side dynamic WebPages using Angular, and Google itself uses this beautiful and powerful framework to build client-side dynamic pages. One of the main features of angular is, we can use angular to build a single page application because it’s based on MVC architecture. Angular supports two-way data binding that requires in real-time application.</p>\n<h2>Advantages</h2>\n<p>With angular, we can quickly develop an application.</p>\n<p>Support MVC architecture.</p>\n<p>Two ways binding a perfect choice for real-time applications</p>\n<p>The ideal framework for single-page applications</p>\n<p>Fast-growing community</p>\n<p>Enhanced design Architecture</p>\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>\n<p>Steep learning curve</p>\n<p>Slow processing</p>\n<p>Limited SEO Option</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--C5Iu9vhG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/srs7igm8b5flk912n1zv.jpeg\"></p>\n<h2>[EN-US] React</h2>\n<p>16 February 2021 | 3 min read</p>\n<p>One of the most popular front-end web development frameworks is <a href=\"https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html\">Reactjs</a> which is developed by Facebook. Though React is not a web development framework but an open-source JavaScript library that is highly used for developing user interfaces.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Using react you can create single page application, and even a mobile app. As React is a library, so it does not support many features like other Front-end frameworks, that’s why to build a proper single page application, React integrates with other libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with API.</p>\n<h2>Advantages</h2>\n<p>it’s virtual DOM support fast manipulation in the document.</p>\n<p>It can be integrated with other libraries</p>\n<p>Support for mobile web-application</p>\n<p>Reusable components</p>\n<p>Easy to use tools</p>\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>\n<p>Does not have well-organized documentation</p>\n<p>Complex structure than JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Less focus on UI</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tXk3J448--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2xz2fk2m9rjt26lkmihe.png\"></p>\n<h2>[EN-US] Vue</h2>\n<p>16 February 2021 | 3 min read</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/\">Vue</a> is another most popular open-source JavaScript framework mainly used for creating a single page application. Vue.js came into existence in February 2014 and is developed by Evan You. This framework uses “high decoupling,” which facilitate developers to create attractive and easy to use user interfaces (UIs).
