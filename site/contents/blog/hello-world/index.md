Next.js is a React framework with a focus on production and efficiency created and maintained by the Vercel team, Next seeks to bring together several features such as hybrid and static content rendering, TypeScript support, pre-fetching, route system, feature packs and several plugins and examples to accelerate your development providing a complete structure for you to start your project. Next.js is an open source framework under the MIT license and is being used by several companies with good growth in the market.

With all these pre-configured facilities it is assimilated to a create react app where you start the project very fast and without worrying about webpack settings, folder structures, route configuration and so on.

Main features of Next.js
Hybrid SSG and SSR: Render the pages during the build (Static Site Generation) or on each request (Server-side Rendering) in the same project.
Hot Code Reloading: Any changes made to your code during development will be reflected in the local application in real time, updating automatically.
Automatic Routing: The URLs in Next js are mapped based on the `pages` folder, so any file in this folder becomes a page, without the need for extra configuration. (you can customize this if you need to)
Automatic Code Splitting: This functionality allows pages to be rendered only with the packages they need. Let's say that only one page of your website uses Ant Design, this package will only be linked to this page. This ensures that each page has only the code necessary for its rendering, decreasing the size (kB) of each page and improving the rendering speed. There was a contribution from the Google team to improve this functionality recently.
TypeScript support: Integrated automatic configuration and compilation similar to an IDE.
Internationalization: As a standard, Next.js already has a structure for identifying different languages, working with exclusive routes and translations via locale.
Image Optimization: Next's native component for optimizing your images with resizing, lazyload, images in a modern format and easy to implement.
Next.js and Server Side Rendering
The big difference at the beginning of Next was the possibility of using rendering on the server side (SSR) this solves a problem in applications and websites built with React that mainly need SEO. In some React applications you will find that it is not always efficient to load all content on the client side (client-side) which is the React standard. Currently Next js is able to work in a hybrid way with SSG and SSR.

Angular is a JavaScript (Typescript) based framework developed by Google for building web applications. Angular was established in 2009 as AngularJS, which used JavaScript as it‚Äôs a programming language, but in 2016, Google completely rewrites Angular. Since then, Angular Use Typescript as its language, typescript, is similar to JavaScript, and it is also considered as the superset of JavaScript.

---

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a front-end Web Framework so we can only make client-side dynamic WebPages using Angular, and Google itself uses this beautiful and powerful framework to build client-side dynamic pages. One of the main features of angular is, we can use angular to build a single page application because it‚Äôs based on MVC architecture. Angular supports two-way data binding that requires in real-time application.

## Advantages

With angular, we can quickly develop an application.

Support MVC architecture.

Two ways binding a perfect choice for real-time applications

The ideal framework for single-page applications

One of the most popular front-end web development frameworks is [Reactjs](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) which is developed by Facebook. Though React is not a web development framework but an open-source JavaScript library that is highly used for developing user interfaces.

---

Using react you can create single page application, and even a mobile app. As React is a library, so it does not support many features like other Front-end frameworks, that‚Äôs why to build a proper single page application, React integrates with other libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with API.

## Advantages

it‚Äôs virtual DOM support fast manipulation in the document.

It can be integrated with other libraries

Support for mobile web-application

Reusable components

## [EN-US] GraphQL vs. REST | What are the diferences?

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedropbazzo/pedropbazzo-blog-gatsby/master/site/contents/blog/hello-world/graphqlvsrest.jpg" />

GraphQL refers to a query language and runtime for application programming interfaces, known for providing users with the precise data they are looking for. GraphQL allows developers to create flexible and fast APIs and can be deployed in an integrated development environment known as GraphiQL. GraphQL is widely considered a viable alternative to REST. Developers using GraphQL can create requests capable of fetching data from multiple sources in one API call.

GraphQL users can add or remove fields in an API without making any changes to existing queries. Users can use their chosen API development methods and rely on GraphQL to maintain the desired functionality for customers.

What are the benefits of GraphQL?
These are the main advantages of using GraphQL:

Declarative data search
GraphQL uses the search for declarative data for its queries. This is advantageous for users, as data can be selected, including its fields and entities, with a single query request on data relationships. GraphQL dictates which fields are required by your UI, functioning in principle as a solution in which the UI is looking for data.

GraphQL queries are efficient in partial data selection for UI operations to retrieve data in a single request. Customers using GraphQL are aware of data requirements, and servers are aware of data structures and requirements for using data from a source.

Solves overfetching
GraphQL does not perform any excessive data searching. This is different from a RESTful API configuration in which a client generally extracts data excessively if there is an identical API. In GraphQL, the mobile client has the option of selecting different sets of fields. This allows GraphQL users to search only for the specific information needed for a user query.

GraphQL is versatile
GraphQL is more versatile than most developers consider. It is decoupled from the back-end and front-end solutions and has JavaScript reference implementation. It facilitates the use of the server side and the client side in JavaScript libraries, including Express, Angular, Hapi, Koa and Vue and several others. GraphQL is capable of working similarly to the language-independent interface of REST.

What are the disadvantages of GraphQL?
These are the main disadvantages of a GraphQL API.

Problems handling complex queries
GraphQL queries can create performance-related problems, while allowing customers to execute specific requests. Problems occur if and when a customer requires many fields nested simultaneously. This is one of the reasons why many users choose the REST API when performing complex queries, as it allows them to search for data through various terminals using precise queries. Despite the need for multiple network calls, avoiding GraphQL performance problems can be a safer option.

Not the best option for small applications
A smaller application may not require GraphQL, as it can benefit from the simplicity of REST. GraphQL is best suited for use cases where there are many multiple services. REST is also preferable as the best option for establishing connections for resource-oriented applications, as they do not need flexible GraphQL queries.

Cache is complex
GraphQL does not use HTTP caching processes that make it easy to store request content. The cache allows users to reduce the amount of traffic to a server, making regularly accessed information more easily available.

Steep learning curve
GraphQL is considered by many to be difficult to understand due to its steep learning curve. Users may need to learn the schema definition language to start using GraphQL. It may not be possible for all projects to allocate time and effort to gain familiarity with GraphQL. As a result, they tend to opt for the easiest to understand REST. Understanding GraphQL queries can take considerable time, although there are several useful resources.

What is REST?

REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for setting standards between web and computer systems. Facilitates the most natural communication between computer systems. RESTful systems are characterized by their statelessness and the tendency to differentiate server and client concerns. In a REST architecture, users can achieve a client and server independent implementation. This means that the client-side code can be changed without having any effect on server operations. In addition, the server side can be changed without having any effect on client operations.

What are the benefits of REST?
Here are the main advantages of a REST API.

REST is scalable
REST is a protocol known for its scalability and preferred by many for this reason. It draws a line between the server and the client, allowing for easier sizing of a product.

It is quite portable and flexible
REST is also known for its flexibility and portability. Users find it easier to port data from one server to another or make changes to a database at any time. Developers can choose to host front-end and back-end on separate servers, allowing for better management.

Offers more independence
As the client and the server are separated in a REST protocol configuration, developers find it much easier to implement developments in different areas of any project independently. In addition, a REST API is able to easily adapt to different platforms and syntax. As a result, developers can make use of different environments during the development phase.

What are the disadvantages of REST?
Here are the disadvantages of a REST API.

Client server
A limitation of REST stems from the fact that it depends on the concept of server and client separate from each other and can grow independently.

Stateless
REST APIs are stateless in nature and allow developers to make independent calls. Each of your calls has all the necessary data for completion.

General requests
REST has not been state and this type of API can increase request overheads, since the bulky loads of incoming and outgoing calls are handled. A REST API must be optimized for caching data.

Interface
Decoupling a client from the server requires a uniform interface that facilitates independent application evolution without requiring the services, actions, or models of the application, which are included in the API layer.

On-demand code
Code on Demand is a feature that allows applets and code transmission through the API to be used in the application.

Layered structure
REST APIs have different architectural layers that create a hierarchical structure for modular and scalable applications.

GraphQL vs REST | What are the diferences?
HTTP status codes
The common status code for each GraphQL request, error or success is 200. It is quite different from the REST APIs, where different status codes point to different responses, that is, 200, 400 and 401 represent success, incorrect and unauthorized request, respectively.

Monitoring
Monitoring is more convenient with HTTP status codes and REST APIs. Performing a health check on a given endpoint gives users an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe API uptime status. For example, a 200 status code means that an API is running. This is in stark contrast to GraphQL, since the analysis of the response body must be performed using a monitoring tool to detect possible errors that are being returned.

Cache
In the REST API, it is possible to cache all server-side GET endpoints with a content delivery network. Endpoints are cached by browsers and marked for regular calls in the future. GraphQL is not compatible with HTTP specifications and is available through a single terminal. As a result, queries are not cached in a manner similar to the REST APIs.

Schema
REST APIs do not depend on schema-type systems. On the other hand, GraphQL uses a type system to create API definitions. Fields mapped to types define a schema, which is a classification agreement between client and server.

GraphQL vs REST comparison table

The table below shows the most fundamental differences between GraphQL and REST.

## [EN-US] AWS vs. Azure vs. Google: Cloud Comparison

<a id="cloud"></a>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedropbazzo/pedropbazzo-blog-gatsby/master/site/contents/blog/hello-world/clouds.png)

The top three cloud computing providers, AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, have strengths and weaknesses that make them ideal for different use cases.

The competition for leadership in public cloud computing is a close race between the giants AWS vs. Azure vs. Google.

Clearly, for infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS), they maintain a high position among the many companies in this segment.

AWS practically dominates the market. In a 2018 report, Synergy Research Group noted that spending on cloud infrastructure services increased by a surprising 51% compared to the previous year's quarter, noting: ‚ÄúAWS's global market share has remained stable at around 33% in the last twelve months, even with the market rising, almost tripled in size ‚Äù.

![](https://blog.saninternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/aws-srgresearch-aws-vs-azure-vs-google-hospedagem-de-sites-san.jpg)

Meanwhile, Microsoft is particularly strong on SaaS, while Google Cloud is positioned for aggressive growth - and is known for offering discounts.

Amazon Web Services has a range of tools that keep growing. Unparalleled features. However, the cost structure can be confusing.

Microsoft Azure has a cloud infrastructure with exceptional capacity. If you are an enterprise customer, Azure is definitely for you - few companies have a corporate history (and Windows support) like Microsoft.

Google Cloud entered the cloud market later and has no corporate focus. But its technical expertise is deep and its market-leading tools in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analysis.

AWS vs. Azure vs. Google: general pros and cons
Many experts recommend that companies assess their public cloud needs on a case-by-case basis and analyze which one offers the best for their needs. Each major supplier has strengths and weaknesses that make them a good choice for certain projects. Want to see?

Pros and cons of AWS

Amazon's greatest strength is its dominance of the public cloud market. In your Quadrante M√°gico de Infraestrutura de Nuvem como Servi√ßo, em todo o mundo, o Gartner observou: ‚ÄúA AWS √© l√≠der em participa√ß√£o de mercado em IaaS na nuvem h√° mais de 10 anos‚Äù. 

![](https://blog.saninternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/aws-services-aws-vs-azure-vs-google-hospedagem-de-sites-SAN-1024x640.png)

Part of the reason for its popularity is undoubtedly the enormous scope of its operations. AWS has a huge and growing range of services available, as well as the most comprehensive network of data centers worldwide. The Gartner report summed it up, saying, "AWS is the most mature and enterprise-ready provider, with the deepest resources to manage a large number of users and resources."

Amazon's big weakness is related to cost. Many companies find it difficult to understand the company's cost structure and manage those costs effectively when performing a high volume of workloads in the service.

When to choose AWS
AWS is a great choice for analytical and web workloads, even large-scale data center migrations, AWS provides a range of services.

When it comes to computing, AWS provides the widest range of VM types. Currently, AWS also has the highest computing and storage options available on the market. Its wide variety of VM types (136 VM types and over 26 VM families) allows customers to run everything from small workloads on the web to the largest workloads.

For machine learning and AI workloads, AWS also provides the highest settings for GPU-enabled VM types. For workloads requiring one-time rentals for compliance and regulatory reasons, AWS now also provides 

https://aws.amazon.com/pt/about-aws/whats-new/2019/02/introducing-five-new-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances/

Block storage comes with a variety of options, such as dynamic resizing, different disk types (magnetic and SSD). Unlike other CSPs, AWS does not restrict IOPS by volume size. You can provision IOPS for an extra cost even for small disks.

In front of the managed relational database, AWS supports managed databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle (SE and EE) and MS SQL (Web and Enterprise editions). In addition, they have their own MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible database, which offers Oracle-like performance for a low investment.

For NoSQL databases, AWS has been offering its DynamoDB product for over half a decade. AWS is an advocate and provides a variety of NoSQL databases created for this purpose. This includes DynamoDB, Neptune and Elasticache.

For network security, AWS has launched managed services to protect against DDoS (AWS Shield) and Web Application Firewall (WAF), along with AWS Inspector, AWS Config and CloudTrail for managing and auditing inventory and policies. GuardDuty provides threat detection.

AWS serves U.S. government workloads in separate US GovCloud regions (CIA and FBI).

Pros and cons of Microsoft Azure
Microsoft was late to the cloud market, but took a step forward, essentially adopting local software - Windows Server, Office, SQL Server, Sharepoint, Dynamics Active Directory, .Net and others - and adapting it again for the cloud.


Azure Services

![](https://blog.saninternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/azure-services-aws-vs-azure-vs-google-hospedagem-de-sites-SAN.png)

A big reason for Azure's success is the integration with Microsoft applications / software. Since Azure is fully integrated with these other applications, companies that use a lot of Microsoft software often find that it also makes sense to use Azure.

When to choose Azure
Azure is a cloud platform of great importance on the market with a variety of features, which can be a preferred platform for customers who are already using Microsoft products. Although Azure supports several services based on open source products, Microsoft's cloud portfolio is what sets it apart from customers.

Azure has more than 151 types of VMs and 26 families that support everything from small workloads to HPC, Oracle and SAP workloads. Azure has Windows and several types of Linux (RHEL, CentOS, SUSE, Ubuntu). Azure has a separate family of instances for ML / AI workloads.

If you need to run next-generation workloads that require up to 128 vCPU and 3.5 TB memory, Azure can do it. If you have existing licenses for Windows OS, MS-SQL and bring them to the cloud (BYOL) through the Microsoft License Mobility Program, Azure is the option.

Azure was also the first cloud player to recognize the hybrid cloud trend. Azure also provided support for hybrid storage devices like StorSimple, which was unique in the public cloud space.

If you have a data center with predominantly Microsoft workloads and need to migrate on a large scale to the cloud, taking advantage of the well-known tools, Azure provides tools and services, such as Azure Site Recovery.

When it comes to SQL and NoSQL databases, Azure has a very complete set of services. It provides MS SQL Server and Managed SQL Datawarehouse. Azure also provides managed databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB.

It provides an API compatible with MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin (Graph) and Azure Table Storage. If you need to run multiple managed data models, including document data models, graphs, key-values, tables and column families in a single cloud, Cosmos may be the best option.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-s-azure-cosmos-db-is-named-a-leader-in-the-forrester-wave-big-data-nosql/

In addition to the pay-per-use credit card billing model and other billing modes, customers with existing corporate accounts can purchase pre-subscriptions to Azure as part of their annual renewals. This is useful for customers who want to budget annual cloud spending in advance. Avoiding uncertainty and additional mid-year budget approvals.

Mobility of cloud licenses for Microsoft products is also relatively easy for customers with multiple Microsoft products running on-premises.

Pros and cons of Google Cloud Platform

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP), despite being late in the game and with the lowest market share of public cloud providers, is showing growth in recent years.

![](https://blog.saninternet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/google-cloud-platform-services-aws-vs-azure-vs-google-hospedagem-de-sites-SAN.png)

Google Cloud Platform Services

It has several features that put you ahead of your competitors in certain areas. GCP is also catching on, not only with new customers who are already part of the ecosystem, but also the first cloud users who want to expand their scenario to Google as part of a multi-cloud strategy. Google also started with PaaS services, but has been constantly expanding its product portfolio.

When to choose GCP
From a computing point of view, Google has the least number of VM sizes (28 instance types in 4 categories). However, it does have a feature that makes these numbers a little irrelevant.

Google allows users to create their own custom sizes (CPU, memory) so that customers can match the size of workloads in the cloud with the size on site. Billing is also based on the total CPU and memory used, rather than individual VMs. This reduces wasted unused capacity.

Another unique feature is that GCP allows almost all instance types to connect GPUs. This can turn any standard or custom instance into an ML-ready VM. Google was also a leader in billing per second, which forced other CSPs to follow suit. Compared to the usual hourly billing standard, billing per second greatly reduces any waste of capacity. This results in savings of up to 40% overall.

Google also linked or purchased third-party cloud migration tools. These tools, such as CloudEndure, Velostrata and CloudPhysics, help customers evaluate, plan and live migrate their VMs to GCP.

Network is the highlight of GCP. They have a low latency global network. Even from the customer's perspective, a VPC network spans all of its regions. Other CSPs limit VPC networks to one region. This makes it easier for GCP customers to create applications that serve customers globally, without creating complex infrastructure design mechanisms across regions and data replication.

For NoSQL Banks, GCP has a product called BigTable. BigTable is a NoSQL database managed on a petabyte scale, used by Google in its own products, such as Gmail.

From a billing point of view, Google offers automatic discounts, such as sustained usage discounts, which lower the price on demand if a VM runs more than a certain number of hours in a month. If you want the most economical cloud provider, GCP is a great option.

Conclusion
Each provider has features and advantages that meet specific customer needs. While all cloud providers will continue to provide certain common services (such as a managed MySQL database), each CSP will create differentiated and exclusive services to address very specific customer needs.

From the customer's perspective, these services will also become a way to adopt a multi-cloud strategy. As an example, a customer may want to use GCP for an application that needs Spanner capabilities, while using AWS for their AI services and Azure for specific Windows workloads.

The trend is to get customers to combine resources and providers to arrive with a high availability and operational capacity solution.

## [EN-US] Cybersecurity Statistics, Predictions, and Solutions for 2021

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedropbazzo/pedropbazzo-blog-gatsby/master/site/contents/blog/hello-world/cyber.jpg" />


In 2020, Cybersecurity has become more important than ever for businesses all over the world. Following various statistics published across the media, we can clearly see that no one is immune against cyber-attacks: major players investing massively in their companies‚Äô cybersecurity, small businesses, and individuals.

Covid-19 pandemic definitely left a huge impact on the overall cybersecurity situation.
First, the global lockdown forced many companies to shift to remote work. Cybercriminals took advantage of vulnerable home networks. Many organizations encountered data breaches at the beginning of the work-from-home shift. For instance:
80% of companies reported an increase in cyberattacks in 2020.

Most of the malware was received from email (94% of cases)
At the beginning of April 2020, Google reported it was blocking every day 18 million malware e-mails related to COVID-19.
Between January and April 2020, the attacks on cloud services increased by 630%
Apparently, the healthcare and financial industries were the most affected ones, as they deal with huge amounts of personal data. For instance, various researches show that:
In 2020, 27% of all cyberattacks targeted healthcare and financial sectors.

From the beginning of February to the end of April 2020, attacks against the banks rose by 238% (when COVID-19 have started spreading).
Most of the financial institutions (82%) reported that it is more and more difficult to fight against cybercriminals, as they become more and more sophisticated.
Even though the businesses are trying to adapt to the growing threats coming from cybercriminals, cybersecurity specialists are not optimistic at all, as their researches show that cybercriminals are changing their way of acting even more, and are not planning to slow down. Here are just some figures and predictions for 2021, presented by 

Cybersecurity Ventures:
By 2021, Cybercrime is expected to cost the world $6.1 trillion annually (more than twice compared to 2015), making it the world‚Äôs third-largest economy, after the USA and China.

The cybersecurity experts predict a cyberattack incident to happen every 11 seconds in 2021 (4 times more than in 2016)
In 2021, 1st place in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Fastest Growing Kind Of Cyber-crime‚Äù will go to Ransomware. As the worldwide costs caused by such kind of damages will reach $20 billion (57 times more than in 2015).
Taking into account all the mentioned statistics and predictions, it is obvious that organizations and individuals must rethink completely their cybersecurity approaches and strategies. 

So what can we all do to resist the cybercrimes more effectively?

Empower your Employees‚Ä¶with Knowledge
It has been proved that 90% of cyber-attacks are related to human errors. Often, people take cybersecurity for granted, and most of the employees are not even aware of cyber-attack types and risks‚Ä¶until it is too late. Any employee, who is not well-informed about cybersecurity, can unwillingly fall victim to cyber-attacks, placing your company and clients at risk. That‚Äôs why it is crucial to educate the employees, especially today when many of them are working from home.
So start spreading cybersecurity awareness right now: provide your employees with all the necessary information concerning cyber threats and bad consequences caused by those; organize cybersecurity training sessions and phishing experiments. Stay in control of the process: make your employees use only secure software and strong passwords, explain to them why they should get the approval of the IT department before installing any software, and why they might have limited access to some data, in some cases.

Protect Proactively

Preventing any damage is always better than repairing it. Cyber-criminals will constantly search the weak points in your company‚Äôs cybersecurity infrastructure, that is why you always have to be ahead of them, detecting an attack before it happens. This way of thinking will help you to reduce the damage and avoid major problems. Take all the necessary precautions to ensure your data is protected.

Any Backup Plans?

Researches show that many companies didn‚Äôt think about any back-up plans and tactics in the case the attackers have succeeded to steal the data.
Again, educate your employees: everyone should be aware of his own responsibilities in all the possible scenarios
Constantly control and monitor the entire data stored and shared inside and outside your company‚Äôs network.
Even though the attacks on cloud storage have increased drastically, never forget to back up your entire content.
But how to make sure that the data stored on your computers and cloud services is really protected‚Ä¶even if it was stolen? The answer is simple. Make it useless for the thieves!

Apparently, as we have seen, following all the figures listed above, your data is ultra-protected not when it cannot be breached (because it always can), but when it cannot be read by unauthorized users.
Today there are various new technologies that render data useless to unauthorized users and protect your data no matter where it is stored. 

For example, Cybervore offers a patented breakthrough technology, which combines authentication, AES 265 encryption, and fragmentation. It is a cybersecurity software called Fragglestorm‚Ñ¢ :

A secure method where data is encrypted, sliced, or split into a defined number of fragments that are replicated, and only the authorized user has access. This offers a way to significantly increase data protection and integrity, and ensure a user‚Äôs data privacy across any on-premise device and cloud storage service.
