## [EN-US] What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework with a focus on production and efficiency created and maintained by the Vercel team, Next seeks to bring together several features such as hybrid and static content rendering, TypeScript support, pre-fetching, route system, feature packs and several plugins and examples to accelerate your development providing a complete structure for you to start your project. Next.js is an open source framework under the MIT license and is being used by several companies with good growth in the market.

With all these pre-configured facilities it is assimilated to a create react app where you start the project very fast and without worrying about webpack settings, folder structures, route configuration and so on.

About Next.js:

Main features of Next.js
Next.js and Server Side Rendering
Mini introductory class on Next.js
How to start a project with Next.js
Indication of plugins and packages
Main features of Next.js
Hybrid SSG and SSR: Render the pages during the build (Static Site Generation) or on each request (Server-side Rendering) in the same project.
Hot Code Reloading: Any changes made to your code during development will be reflected in the local application in real time, updating automatically.
Automatic Routing: The URLs in Next js are mapped based on the `pages` folder, so any file in this folder becomes a page, without the need for extra configuration. (you can customize this if you need to)
Automatic Code Splitting: This functionality allows pages to be rendered only with the packages they need. Let's say that only one page of your website uses Ant Design, this package will only be linked to this page. This ensures that each page has only the code necessary for its rendering, decreasing the size (kB) of each page and improving the rendering speed. There was a contribution from the Google team to improve this functionality recently.
TypeScript support: Integrated automatic configuration and compilation similar to an IDE.
Internationalization: As a standard, Next.js already has a structure for identifying different languages, working with exclusive routes and translations via locale.
Image Optimization: Next's native component for optimizing your images with resizing, lazyload, images in a modern format and easy to implement.
Next.js and Server Side Rendering
The big difference at the beginning of Next was the possibility of using rendering on the server side (SSR) this solves a problem in applications and websites built with React that mainly need SEO. In some React applications you will find that it is not always efficient to load all content on the client side (client-side) which is the React standard. Currently Next js is able to work in a hybrid way with SSG and SSR.
