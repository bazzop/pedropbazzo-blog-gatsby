Next.js is a React framework with a focus on production and efficiency created and maintained by the Vercel team, Next seeks to bring together several features such as hybrid and static content rendering, TypeScript support, pre-fetching, route system, feature packs and several plugins and examples to accelerate your development providing a complete structure for you to start your project. Next.js is an open source framework under the MIT license and is being used by several companies with good growth in the market.

With all these pre-configured facilities it is assimilated to a create react app where you start the project very fast and without worrying about webpack settings, folder structures, route configuration and so on.

Main features of Next.js
Hybrid SSG and SSR: Render the pages during the build (Static Site Generation) or on each request (Server-side Rendering) in the same project.
Hot Code Reloading: Any changes made to your code during development will be reflected in the local application in real time, updating automatically.
Automatic Routing: The URLs in Next js are mapped based on the `pages` folder, so any file in this folder becomes a page, without the need for extra configuration. (you can customize this if you need to)
Automatic Code Splitting: This functionality allows pages to be rendered only with the packages they need. Let's say that only one page of your website uses Ant Design, this package will only be linked to this page. This ensures that each page has only the code necessary for its rendering, decreasing the size (kB) of each page and improving the rendering speed. There was a contribution from the Google team to improve this functionality recently.
TypeScript support: Integrated automatic configuration and compilation similar to an IDE.
Internationalization: As a standard, Next.js already has a structure for identifying different languages, working with exclusive routes and translations via locale.
Image Optimization: Next's native component for optimizing your images with resizing, lazyload, images in a modern format and easy to implement.
Next.js and Server Side Rendering
The big difference at the beginning of Next was the possibility of using rendering on the server side (SSR) this solves a problem in applications and websites built with React that mainly need SEO. In some React applications you will find that it is not always efficient to load all content on the client side (client-side) which is the React standard. Currently Next js is able to work in a hybrid way with SSG and SSR.

Angular is a JavaScript (Typescript) based framework developed by Google for building web applications. Angular was established in 2009 as AngularJS, which used JavaScript as it‚Äôs a programming language, but in 2016, Google completely rewrites Angular. Since then, Angular Use Typescript as its language, typescript, is similar to JavaScript, and it is also considered as the superset of JavaScript.

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a front-end Web Framework so we can only make client-side dynamic WebPages using Angular, and Google itself uses this beautiful and powerful framework to build client-side dynamic pages. One of the main features of angular is, we can use angular to build a single page application because it‚Äôs based on MVC architecture. Angular supports two-way data binding that requires in real-time application.

## Advantages

With angular, we can quickly develop an application.

Support MVC architecture.

Two ways binding a perfect choice for real-time applications

The ideal framework for single-page applications

Fast-growing community

Enhanced design Architecture

## Disadvantages

Steep learning curve

Slow processing

Limited SEO Option

One of the most popular front-end web development frameworks is [Reactjs](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) which is developed by Facebook. Though React is not a web development framework but an open-source JavaScript library that is highly used for developing user interfaces.

---

Using react you can create single page application, and even a mobile app. As React is a library, so it does not support many features like other Front-end frameworks, that‚Äôs why to build a proper single page application, React integrates with other libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with API.

## Advantages

it‚Äôs virtual DOM support fast manipulation in the document.

It can be integrated with other libraries

Support for mobile web-application

Reusable components

Easy to use tools

## Disadvantages

Does not have well-organized documentation

Complex structure than JavaScript.

Less focus on UI

## Advantages

Fast Development

Small size

Easy to maintain and to learn

Can be integrated with other applications

Virtual DOM rendering and performance

Components reusability

Solid tooling ecosystem

## Disadvantages

Does not have stable tools
